source
======

We may have only a single source or multiple sources. Furthermore, our sources can be defined as polarized or as dipole transmitter.
Polarization of the source is given as a function which solely depends on the source.
However, considering a dipole transmitter source depends on the direction of the transmitter antenna respect to the receiver.
Therefore, the modules related to the the dipole transmitter is given in another class :py:class:`source_antenna.SourceAntenna`.


:argument:
    - source_fn: the file name containing the values of the wave source variables
    - dipole: To define if the source is a dipole transmitter or not.

:attributes:
    - source_charc: Dataframe, source of wave variables
    - source_n: Integer:, the number of the wave sources
    - s_columns: List, the header of the column name for creating the DataFrame
    - source_location: Array, the location of wave sources

:methods:
    - polarization: To calculate the Jones vector of the source. It gets phase angles.
    - read_source: To read the source input file
    - wave_num: to calculate the wave number of source signals
