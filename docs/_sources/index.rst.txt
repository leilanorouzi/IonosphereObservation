Input files
+++++++++++

To run this project we need information about the source, the environment and the receivers.
The antenna and source information are stored in two txt files :file:`source2.txt` and :file:`03-tri_2.txt`.
The medium parameters can be found in :file:`parameters.py`.

File description
________________
- **03-tri\_2.txt**: antenna information
- **source2.txt**: source information
- **parameters.py**: This file contains some parameters
- **reading\_files.py**: This file contains function to read input files of the source and the antenna.
- **source.py**: This file contains  source such as reading source input file, exporting location locations and parameters, and polarization.
- **antenna.py**: This file contains methods to define the property of the antennas such as locations.
- **source\-antenna.py**: It deals with methods which are only involve source and antenna, regardless the environment, such as the distance between the antenna and the sources or defining the dipole transmitters as a source.
- **wave\_propagation**: Contains the main class and function to calculate the results for the waves received at the location of antenna from the source/s.
- **multi\_source\_received\_waves**: The main program file.
- **visualization**: Include codes for plotting and visualization purposes.
- **geometry.py**: This file includes all function required for calculating geometrical parameters and variables.

How to run?
___________
Please copy and past all files (mentioned in the file description) to a directory. Then, in that directory, you can run the main program by typing `python multi_source_receieved_waves.py`.
