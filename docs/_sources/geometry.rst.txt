geometry
========

The field vector is calculating in the reference frame system that the z direction is attached to the ray path.
In order to obtain the received field vector at the antenna in the original frame, we need to rotate ray-path attached frame tot the original one.
Please look at the picture:

:methods:
    - dist: to calculate the distance between two points in Cartesian coordinate
