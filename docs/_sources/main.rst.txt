Main code
=========

The main code :py:mod:`multi_source_receieved_waves.main` runs other modules and plot the graphics.
After importing input data, you can call :py:class:`visualization.visualization` to plot or :py:class:`wave_propagation.WavePropagation`
to calculate different results.

:Example:

>>> from wave_propagation import *
>>> wp = WavePropagation(radar_fn,source_fn,dipole)
>>> wave = wp.antennna_wave_received()
>>> vis = visualization(a=wp.antenna_location, s=wp.source_location)
>>> vis.source_antenna_location()




Import data
+++++++++++

There are 2 options to import the data:

1- You can select the data folder. When you ru the code, a window will open and asks you to choose the inout data folder. It runs :py:func:`multi_source_receieved_waves.select_directory` function.

2- or you can type it in here directly.
If you would like to use this method please, comment above line and uncomment following line and replace the directory path with the location of the input data in you code.

``input_dir = "../IonosphereObservation/Data/Input/"``
