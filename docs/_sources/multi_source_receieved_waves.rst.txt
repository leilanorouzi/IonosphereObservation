multi\_source\_receieved\_waves module
======================================


The main code to run other modules and plot the graphics.
After importing input data, you can call :py:class:`visualization` to plot or :py:class:`multi_source`
to calculate different results.

:Example:

>>> from multi_source import *
>>> ms = multi_source(radar_fn,source_fn)
>>> phase, wave = ms.antennna_wave_received()
>>> vis = visualization(a=ms.antenna_location, s=ms.source_location)
>>> vis.source_antenna_location()

2- or you can type it in here directly.
If you would like to use this method please, comment above line and uncomment following line and replace the directory path with the location of the input data in you code.
