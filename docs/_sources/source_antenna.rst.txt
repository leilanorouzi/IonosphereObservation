source\_antenna
===============

To define a dipole transmitter source not only depends ont the source characteristics but depends on the position of the receiver respect to the transmitter.
Therefore, the source will be unique for each receiver antennas.

The transmitter antennas were considered to be fix respect to the reference frame and similar for all sources.  Please refer to :ref:`dipole_plot`.

:argument:
    - class: :py:class:`Source`
    - class: :py:class:`Antenna`

:attributes:
    - distance: DataFrame, the distance between source/s and antennas
    - path_vec: DataFrame, the vectors of path from antenna to source/s

:methods:
    - multi_dist: to calculate the distance and the vector between each set of source-antenna. It calls dist function to calculate the distance.
    - dipole_transmitter: It obtains the oscillation of far field located in the ionosphere.
